# Abstract

The `constexpr` metaprogramming model, which involves annotating code with
indicators of compile-time or run-time suitability, has been steadily
increasing in capabilities since its debut in C++11. These efforts have been in
support of the stated goal of making metaprogramming accessible to even novice
developers. Unfortunately, the simultaneous mixture and stratification of run
time and compile time code has resulted in a complicated and unintuitive
programming model. Elsewhere Sean Baxter, a relatively unknown compiler
designer disconnected from the committee, has designed an extremely compelling
alternative that is intuitive, more powerful, and completely implemented. This
paper describes the limitations of the `constexpr` metaprogramming model and
introduces its persuasive alternative, the circle metaprogramming model.

```c++
// test.cpp
#include <iostream>

@meta        std::cout << "Hello at compile time!" << std::endl;
int main() { std::cout << "Hello at run time!"     << std::endl; }
```

```console
$ circle test.cpp
Hello at compile time!
$ ./test
Hello at run time!
```

# Introduction

In 2017 SG7, formerly known as the compile-time reflection study group, made a
decision to effectively move C++ away from template metaprogramming and toward `constexpr`
metaprogramming. It was a bold move, but it was sorely needed. Use of the
template metaprogramming model, which dominated C++ until recent years, was
relegated to the use of a few C++ experts that endured learning a "by accident"
functional language with libraries like [@Boost.MPL]. The hope was that
expanding the scope and usage of `constexpr` would allow developers to write
metaprogramming code the same way they write runtime code. [@P0425R0]
summarized the consensus at the time when it stated, "If this can be made to
work, this would be the best and most consistent approach to do metaprogramming
in C++."

With the direction set a slew of papers were developed to extend the
capabilities of `constexpr` metaprogramming. This included `constexpr` dynamic
allocation [@P0784R7], virtual functions [@P1064R0], try blocks [@P1002R1], and
nontrivial destructors. The more fundamental additions of
`std::is_constant_evaluated()` [@P0595R2], `consteval` functions [@P1073R3],
and consteval variables [@P0596R1] came as well.

Each of these papers brought with them, unexpectedly, user-facing tradeoffs
that chipped away at the original vision of a metaprogramming model that mimics
the run time programming model. These tradeoffs stem primarily from the
following `constexpr` metaprogramming design choices:

1. The distinctions between run time, compile time, and run/compile time
   functions.
2. Detection of the above distinction using an implicit "a posteriori" model.
3. The implicit and subtle interleave between run time and compile time
   constructs.

Section 3 goes into more detail on this.

Parallel to this standardization effort a single engineer, Sean Baxter, in
September 2016 decided to embark upon writing an LLVM-based C++ compiler from
scratch to implement a radically different approach to metaprogramming. The
resulting compiler, [@Circle], is now freely available for evaluation.
According to the website _"it's like c++ that went away to train with the
league of shadows and came back 15 years later and became batman"_. Circle is
C++17 compatible and, aside from its own numerous language additions, includes
several extensions that are expected in C++20 (e.g. concepts) and beyond (e.g.
pattern matching). Only recently has the C++ standardization committee become
aware of Sean's work on Circle.

Sean's approach to metaprogramming is based on a few simple principles:

1. C++ run time code should be executable at compile time without modification.
2. The compiler run time and the application run time should be independent.
3. Promotion of code and data from compile time to run time is accomplished
   primarily through injection.

Circle's metaprogramming approach has sidestepped much of the complexity that
comes with `constexpr` metaprogramming by allowing all code to be executed at
compile time and clearly distinguishing between compile-time and run-time
execution. The result, in the opinion of the author, is a truly accessible
metaprogramming model where other modules thus far presented have failed.
Circle is described in Sections 4 and 5.
